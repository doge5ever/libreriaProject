# Test

This project aims to demonstrate the skills learned in Software Development, both front-end and back-end, and in Data Science. This project is an online bookstore that will be able to enable users to purchase books online. It will include a recommender system for products and tags, using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and Machine Learning models. 

Data Science techniques will mostly be reflected in Jupyter notebooks where supporting explanations are included.

# Seed Database

To seed the MongoDB database, execute a GET method to the route "/api/seed-database".
